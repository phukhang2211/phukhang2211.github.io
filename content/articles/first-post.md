Summary: Starting my journey with COVID-19 mapping using GIS and learning web development.

# My First COVID-19 Mapping Project

Today I'm starting an exciting project to create a COVID-19 map using GIS technology. This project combines my interests in Python programming and geographical data analysis.

## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from several reliable sources:

1. **HCMGIS**: Working with experienced professionals who are guiding me through the GIS aspects
2. **COVID-19 Dataset**: Using the [official COVID-19 data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
3. **OpenData HCMGIS**: Accessing data from [opendata.hcmgis.vn](http://opendata.hcmgis.vn/)

## Learning Resources

I'm fortunate to have great resources to help me learn:

- Python programming mentorship from Mr. HVN at [Pymi](https://pymi.vn/)
- Additional programming resources from [Familug](https://www.familug.org/)
- Direct guidance from HCMGIS professionals

## Next Steps

1. Set up the GIS development environment
2. Learn how to process COVID-19 data
3. Create interactive map visualizations
4. Implement web integration

Stay tuned for updates on this project!
