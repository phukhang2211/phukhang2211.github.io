Summary: My journey learning how to create a static blog with Python and Pelican

Today I started learning how to create a static blog using Pelican, a Python-based static site generator. Here's what I've learned so far:

## Why Pelican?

1. **Python-based**: Since I'm already learning Python, it's perfect!
2. **Markdown Support**: Easy to write content in Markdown
3. **Simple Setup**: Just a few configuration files needed
4. **GitHub Pages**: Easy to deploy to GitHub Pages

## What I've Done

- Set up a basic Pelican site
- Created my first blog posts
- Added an About page
- Configured the theme
- Learned about Markdown formatting

## Next Steps

I plan to:
1. Add more content regularly
2. Customize the theme
3. Add more features like comments and analytics
4. Share my learning journey

Stay tuned for more updates!
